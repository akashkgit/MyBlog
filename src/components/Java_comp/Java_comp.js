              <p > Java is not 100% an object oriented programming language.This is because, it has support for primitive non 
              objectified data types like int,float,double et cetera. A 100% object oriented programming language should not 
              support primitive non objectified data types and everything should be objectified. Eventhough, Java supports wrapper 
              class,its still not !00% OOPs as it  has support for int,double et cetera

              Java supports multiple inheritance of interfaces and also mixed inheritance of multiple interface and a single class. So, its a Yes!
