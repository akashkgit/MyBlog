                <li><span className={styles.mark} >Modular OS </span> This type of OS installs modules as per the need of the application.

                1. User services(Not so important)  2.Kernel Service(Not so important). So, any user application requiring user services will communicate with user services in user 
                address space through message passing. Since, the kernel handles less no. of services, it can work faster.

                A proces is an installed active program like MS word,notepad et cetera. These process has a virtual memery address that points to a 
               physical memory location in the RAM. If a process has some unused space OS, tries to share it with other processes.
               Any two processes can have same virtual address but, they poin tot different physical address. These address conversions are done using page tables.
               Os knows the state of the process by looking into

               </ul>
               details related to  a process are stored in <span className={styles.mark} >PCB(Process Control Block)</span>.
               When the CPU switches to another process(Context Switch), it stores the current process contents in its PCB and then loads the 
               PCB of the new process leading to hot cache. After context switch, when P1 is switched again, its content will not be availabe in the cache. This is called cold cache(cache miss).
               P1 and P2 communcate using INter process communication like shared memory and message passing.

                Threads are subordinate workers pf a process.A process can have multiple threads. All the the threads of a process share the same location.
                At a time, only one thread can be proccsed by a CPU. So, multi threading requires multi cores in a CPU. A thread context switch can occur of only if 
                t <sub> idle</sub> is less than 2 times  t<sub> context-switch</sub>.context switch of process take more tim than threads switch due to address converion (virtual to physical)

              <p> 
              Mutex is a thread management library. It can lock the threads.once locked ither threads seeking the critical section are block unless the critical section is unlocked.
              But, try lock does nt block the incoming threads. Instead the incoming threads try acquiring the lock again and again. This si also called spin lock.
              <span className={styles.mark} >Binary Semaphore</span> is a type of semaphore where the semaphore variable value has 0 or 1.
              Semaphore has two blocks wait{} and post{}. In wait, each thread waits if the value is 0. If the value is 1, the thread get exxecuted.
              Once, it completes, the post block is executed. In post block, the thread increments the value by 1.
              Now the threads waiting in wait block, sees that the value has become 1 and tries to acquire lock to Crit. sec. . Once, a thread acquires Crti. sec. ,
              it decrements the value to 0 in wait block. Now, since the value is 0, other threads have to wait.
              <span className={styles.mark} >Counting Semaphore</span> It is smae as binary Semaphore. Instead of 2 values, it can have any range of values from 0 depending 
              on the size of wait queue and parallel cores.If the value is 10, then 10 threads in wait block can acquire the lock. Semaphore is usually used with process.
              <span className={styles.mark} >Condition varible</span> Mutex can lock based on a conditon variable by signalling it other threads.
